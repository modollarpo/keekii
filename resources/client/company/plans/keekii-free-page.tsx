            Free plays the same tracks, albums and artists as Premium. If you
            listen on a device with a good connection and do not mind
            advertising, Keekii Free is a perfectly good way to use Keekii --
            permanently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Premium exists for the things Free cannot do: downloads, no
            advertising, and unlimited skips. If none of those matter to you,
            stay on Free.
