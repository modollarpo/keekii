            It is not a popularity contest run by a label, and it is not a
            prediction of what will be big next month. It is the least
            gameable version we could build: plays, weighted by whether people
            finished them, located by where they were listening.
          </p>
          <p>
            The honest limitation is coverage. A market with a smaller listener
            base on Keekii will have a noisier chart than the UK, and a track
            with a committed local audience can out-chart a much larger streaming
            number. That is a real property of a listener-driven chart and we
            would rather you know it than assume otherwise.
