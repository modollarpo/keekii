            Keekii Free shows advertising. Ads never appear in a Premium session,
            and they are not allowed into the player in a way that stops you
            listening -- if an ad interrupted playback, it would cost us more
            listeners than it earns.

          <p>
            If you would rather not see ads at all, Premium is the way to remove
            them, and Premium also funds more free accounts for everyone else.
